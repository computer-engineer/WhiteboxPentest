## Source Code Review Methdologies
S. No| Approach|
|     :---:      |     :---:      |
|1|String matching/Grep for bugs |
|2|Following user input|
|3|Reading source code randomly|
|4|Read all the code|
|5|Check one functionality at a time (login, password reset...)|

## Enable Database Logging

<details><summary>MySQL/MariaDB</summary>
<p>
Modify the following values on my.cnf file(Typically located at /etc/mysql/my.cnf)</br>

    ```
     [mysqld]
     general_log_file = /var/log/mysql/mariadb.log
     general_log = 1
    ```
*In case of mariadb the settings will be present under `[mariadb]`</br>
Restart the mysql service for the change to take affect</br>
You can read the log file in realtime using `sudo tail -f /var/log/mysql/mysql.log`
</p>

## :tada: Code Review Checklist
- [x] Identify Tech Stack: 
    - [x] Programming language? What version, i.e., PHP 5 or 7? 
    - [x] Database? 
    - [x] Framework?
    - [x] Templating engine?
    - [x] Is it MVC based?
    - [x] What are the communication protocols, does it use websockets?
    - [x] Does it have an API?
    - [x] What Opertating System? find ubuntu version using lsb_release -a
- [x] Map the app
    - [x] Use `tree -L 3` command, open the app in `VSCode` or build a sitemap using `burp suite` to understand the application directory structure
    - [x] What are the routes/pages? If java app search for `doPost` and `doGet`. In case of python find routes starting with `@`
    - [x] Is the app MVC based? where are the `Models`, `Views` and `Controllers` located?
- [x] Explore the app
    - [x] Is the application running as root?
    - [x] Which pages don't require authentication? You can prioritise testing them first
    - [x] MVC: Check if some logic breaks the MVC driven pattern, try to search for direct SQL queries within controller
- [x] Discover vulnerabilities
    - [x] What are the interesting functionalities? Password reset, comment section visible to all users, search bar etc
    - [x] SQLi: Find database queries using regex `^.*?query.*?select.*?`
    - [x] SSTI: Find templating engine, you might have a similar line `app.set('view engine', 'pug');` in `app.js`
    - [x] DOM based XSS: Grep for sinks. REF: https://domgo.at/cxss/sinks 
    - [x] Weak random token generator: `java.util.random` is vulnerable
